What:
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. (CBT) is an instrument used in psychotherapy to help people change thoughts, feelings and behaviours that are causing them problems.
CBT refers to many types of psychotherapeutic systems that deal with cognitions, interpretations, beliefs and responses. It is used to try and change problem-causing emotions and behaviours.
It can be used to treat mood disorders (like depression), personality disorders (like borderline personality disorder), posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias and drug addiction. CBT can take place one-on-one between a therapist and a client, during group therapy, or online.

Why:
There’s currently nothing “online” or on  the app stores of Android and Apple, that really efficiently gets the to the point of what CBT is.
A psychologist, will normally give you instructions or “work sheets”. (yes, paper) in which you have small columns, with fingers and pens that can’t fit inside them. In the end, you throw the paper away.

It’s something like this:




How will we fix it?
By not doing the above.

We’re going to turn a paper-based therapy, into an electronic version and ready for this century. Why would anyone choose this application over a notebook, or whatever their therapist has given them? Easy.

You’re on a bus. A big smelly man sits next to you. He reminds you of someone, someone who once used to look into your windows whenever he could. You would always know he was there by his smell. You know he went to prison. He’s still there. This man reminds you of him, you’re beginning to get anxious, very anxious, you’re sweating and you want to scream and jump out of the bus but the words from your therapist come sliding through the slog: “Use the application. Record your feelings, record your mood, record your setting. You can do it”.

You pull out your phone, everyone thinks you’re checking Facebook. You pull up the app and you’re greeted by a series of icons, each representing a mood (recently used). You tap the anxious face, and you smile a bit - the icon throws you off. You enter a screen, you’ve only got room for 200 characters. You type in about the smelly guy. You move the slider, to show how bad you felt on a scale of 0 to 10. You then put the environment (bus, home, friends house, work ect). You press the save button. You sit back, and you sigh. “It’s not him. It’s not him.” You think more about what the therapist has been telling you.

If the user is far enough along in their CBT therapy, using this application, they will have a graphical proof of their progress.  [this could be an option that is locked/unlocked by their therapist. so anyone could install the application, but a therapist who pays $X to us, gets the option to pair the application stats, and thus lock and unlock certain features they deem necessary or unnecessary to the persons mental health]  This will allow the user to therefore look back on times they’ve been in a certain environment with a certain trigger and go: “Wow, I’ve come along way”. In psychology, this is seen as a major achievement.








People will use this?
Yes. The major elements are that it must be simple, and easy to use. The user interface must simply flow. There will be no advertisements, no intrusive texts, just straight forward. Without these, it will not work.

Example workflow:
Choose mood (happy, unhappy, anxious, sad, frustrated, angry, depressed)
[screen changes]
Write the trigger (or choose from previous entry)
Write a short description on what caused the trigger/mood (can choose from a previous entry). This must be a limited field. (think Twitter)
Using a slider, from 0 to 10 to describe the intensity of this feeling caused by the trigger. [this explains the need for the user to be able to pull a previous entry. it might be the same, but the feeling intensity may be less or worse]

Ray’s comments:
i guess flat simple designs are better now that i think about it having it cute and cuddly could skew your emotions. best there’s a disconnect between the emotion you are trying to pick and the design of the emotions themselves
